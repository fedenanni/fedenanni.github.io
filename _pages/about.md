Hi! I am a Senior Research Data Scientist at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), working as part of the [Research Engineering Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group). I lead research engineering efforts in adopting and adapting large language models for a wide range of research applications. I also hold an honorary position at [UCLâ€™s Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/), where I offer training and supervision to students on large language models and their applications in research.

I have a background in natural language processing and information retrieval, with a focus on their applications to academic research projects.
