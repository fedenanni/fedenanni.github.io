Hi! I am a Senior Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute, working as part of the Research Engineering Group. I lead research engineering efforts in adopting and adapting large language models for a wide range of research applications. I also hold an honorary position at UCLâ€™s Advanced Research Computing Centre, where I offer training and supervision to students on large language models and their applications in research.

I have a background in natural language processing and information retrieval, with a focus on their applications to academic research projects.
